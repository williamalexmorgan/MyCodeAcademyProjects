# Welcome to My Portfolio

My name is Alex and I am a ambitious web developer. I am currently working through projects with Code Academy, and currently enrolled in the Web developer tract. Below is a demonstration of the knowledge I have acquired through Code Academy, through the final projects in each section. Text in each code is provided by Code Academy, however the code for each project is coded by me. The projects in each course start from simple and devlop into more complex projects.
